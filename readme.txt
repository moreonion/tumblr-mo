----------------------

This tumblr theme is supposed to be a quick starting point for mo styled tumblogs.
To apply it to a new tumblog you have to use the tumblr_theme file and paste it into the "custom HTML theme" field on tumblr

Then you should decide if you want a "Sign up via email" button or not. If you want one, you'll have to replace the link URL so users end up on a signup form :-)

You should also check the fonts.com project settings so that fonts are loaded on the URL. Simply add the URL to the tumblogs project in fonts.com

The attached stylesheet (generated from the less file) will always be loaded from github pages (linked from the HTML head of the tumblr theme). Change things, but bare in mind that all tumblogs will change if the stylesheet is changed.

Have fun!
