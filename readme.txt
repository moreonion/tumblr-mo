README
----------------------

This tumblr theme is supposed to be a quick starting point for mo styled tumblogs.
To apply it to a new tumblog you have to use the tumblr_theme file and paste it into the "custom HTML theme" field on tumblr


Share & signup
----------

Then you should decide if you want a "Sign up via email" button or not. If you want one, you'll have to replace the link URL so users end up on a signup form :-)


Fonts
----------

You should also check the fonts.com project settings so that fonts are loaded on the URL. Simply add the URL to the tumblogs project in fonts.com


Styling
----------

The attached stylesheet (generated from the less file) will always be loaded from github pages (linked from the HTML head of the tumblr theme). Change things, but bare in mind that all tumblogs will change if the stylesheet is changed.


Tumblr theme settings
----------

title colour: #444444
accent colour: #826ba3
body text: #333333

Change
title font to: DIN Next W01 Heavy
body font to: KingsCaslonW01-Regular
Post headline font to: DIN Next W01 Heavy


Meta tags etc.
----------

Make sure you go through all meta tags, in particular OG and twitter card tags. These will change from tumblog to tumblog. They are in the tumblr pile of HTML stored in this git rep (tumblr_theme)


Have fun!
